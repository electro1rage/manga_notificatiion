# manga_notificatiion
Somehow notify about the latest manga chapter I didn't read.

-------------------------------

Add the name of the manga you are following in the manga_followed file.
The name should be the name in the url.
Ex: http://mangafox.me/manga/the_gamer
Then you should add "the_gamer" to the file.

Some examples are present in the manga_followed file.


-------------------------------

The first time you run the script you should clear out the last_chapter file.

-------------------------------

How to run the script

Change directory to the MangaController.py file:

```python
python3 MangaController.py
```
